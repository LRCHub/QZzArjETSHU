[00:07.94] Just like the white winged dove
[00:10.64] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[00:13.28] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[00:19.78] 
[00:16.54] Just like the white winged dove
[00:19.11] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[00:22.17] Ooh, baby, ooh
[00:24.12] Said Ooh
[00:28.12] 
[00:26.12] And the days go by like a strand in the wind
[00:30.44] In the web that is my own, I begin again
[00:35.26] Said to my friend, baby, nothing else mattered
[00:43.97] He was no more (he was no more) than a baby then
[00:51.99] Well he seemed broken hearted
[00:55.68] Something within him
[01:00.72] But the moment that I first laid
[01:05.52] Eyes on him, all alone
[01:09.78] On the edge of seventeen
[01:21.78] 
[01:17.58] Just like the white winged dove
[01:20.10] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[01:22.70] I said Ooh, baby, ooh
[01:24.66] Said Ooh
[01:28.66] 
[01:26.13] Just like the white winged dove
[01:28.86] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[01:31.32] I said Ooh, baby, ooh
[01:33.35] Said Ooh
[01:37.35] 
[01:35.75] Well, I went today
[01:37.48] Maybe I will go again tomorrow
[01:42.97] Yeah, yeah, yeah, well the music there
[01:46.26] Well, it was hauntingly familiar
[01:52.77] Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me
[01:57.06] With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
[02:01.42] And a melody, nothing else mattered
[02:18.92] 
[02:09.31] Just like the white winged dove
[02:11.85] (Just like the white winged dove)
[02:13.65] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[02:14.68] I said Ooh, baby, ooh
[02:16.65] Said Ooh
[02:20.65] 
[02:17.89] Just like the white winged dove
[02:20.62] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[02:23.08] I said Ooh, baby, ooh
[02:25.23] Said Ooh
[02:29.23] 
[02:27.28] The clouds never expect it when it rains
[02:33.16] But the sea changes colors, but the sea
[02:39.63] Does not change
[02:47.13] 
[02:44.97] And so with the slow, graceful flow of age
[02:52.97] I went forth with an age old desire to please
[03:01.85] On the edge of seventeen
[03:13.85] 
[03:27.66] Just like the white winged dove
[03:29.86] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[03:32.65] Ooh, baby, ooh
[03:34.36] Said Ooh
[03:38.36] 
[03:35.52] Just like the white winged dove
[03:38.29] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[03:40.53] Ooh, baby, ooh
[03:42.75] Said Ooh
[03:46.75] 
[03:44.64] Well, then suddenly
[03:46.88] There was no one left standing in the hall, yeah yeah
[03:53.33] In a flood of tears
[03:55.52] That no one really ever heard fall at all
[04:01.64] Well, I went searching for an answer
[04:03.90] Up the stairs and down the hall
[04:06.38] And not to find an answer
[04:08.27] Just to hear the call
[04:10.12] Of a nightbird singing come away (come away)
[04:32.12] 
[04:18.13] Just like the white winged dove
[04:20.42] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[04:23.31] Ooh, baby, ooh
[04:25.10] Said Ooh
[04:29.10] 
[04:26.41] Just like the white winged dove
[04:29.04] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[04:31.87] Ooh, baby, ooh
[04:33.65] Said Ooh
[04:37.65] 
[04:35.82] Well I hear you in the morning (in the morning)
[04:40.12] And I hear you, at nightfall
[04:44.38] Sometime to be near you
[04:48.29] Is to be unable to hear you, my love
[05:00.00] I'm a few years older than you
[05:04.23] (I'm a few years older than you) my love
[05:24.23] 
[05:09.06] Just like the white winged dove
[05:11.56] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[05:14.30] Ooh, baby, ooh
[05:15.83] Said Ooh
[05:19.83] 
[05:17.28] Just like the white winged dove
[05:19.39] Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
[05:22.56] Ooh, baby, ooh...
