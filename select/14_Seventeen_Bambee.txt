All along the shore
We sit together in the calm of the summer breeze
I move a little closer
And I slip my arms in yours

The sun shines bright upon the ocean waters
There until the glow of the evening
Sweep me up like the waves
And hold me tight in your arms

Tell me that you love me too
Knowing that you care
Makes me feel alive

Underneath the summer sky
We sit in silence in the warmth of the midday sun
With my head upon your shoulder
I melt into your embrace

The birds fly high above the ocean waters
There until the hush of the evening
Take me up like the tide
I'll always stay by your side

Love me the way I love you
Knowing that you care
Makes me feel alive

Our love is deeper than the ocean waters
Kiss me till the turn of the evening
Like the sand needs the sea
Your heart belongs here with me

Love me like I love you
Knowing that you love me (knowing you love me)
I feel so alive (you make my dreams come true)
Knowing that you love me (ooh)
I feel so alive (just you and me)
Knowing that you love me (knowing you love me)
I feel so alive (you make my dreams come true)
Knowing that you love me (ooh)
I feel so alive (ooh)
